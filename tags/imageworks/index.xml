      <description>A very special project. I joined the show at the end for the last push. The amount of work done in compositing was tremendous, a lot was done in Nuke where we could be creative.
I worked on multiple sequences on lighting and shared some shots for the compositing task.</description>

      <description>First project with Katana. After one week of training that taught us the basics of Katana, we jumped into production.
Making the white characters readable on white snow was challenging. Scene optimization was a must for a show with crowd of hairy characters.
I worked on multiple sequences from lighting to compositing, 3D stereo included.</description>
