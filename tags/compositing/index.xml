      <description>Coming back to Animal Logic after five years as a senior lighting artist. The studio developped their own lighting software for their USD pipeline. But thanks to my previous expeience, it was fairly easy to pick it up. Mostly because the logic behind it was still the same.
We don&amp;rsquo;t always work on the most exciting shots on a production. As I started, another artist left. So I ended up picking up their shots to complete them.</description>

      <description>Introduction Sonic Prime was the first show using Katana at Wildbrain. Most of the artists had no previous experience with this software. They had to be train and helped during production.
The lighting department had two teams, each one was composed of a lead, three seniors and eight artists. My role was to lead my team and achieve the creative lighting goals of the director for the episode.
Preparing I had to plan episode to achieve deliverables.</description>

      <description>I worked on 6 shorts and 10 episodes of the first season. Each episode was 11 minutes long and usually had between 4 or 5 keyshots. Most of the time I was in charge of 2 or 3 that had effects. My role was to setup keyshots in lighting and compositing beforehand. I would then work with my team on the rest of the episode.</description>

      <description>My first project on episodic. The process is quite different than feature. You rely on being the most efficient and setting things up globally. One light rig to control as many shots as possible. I worked on episode 1 and 3. My sequences were for the most part heavy in effects (snow storm and sand storm).</description>

      <description>Worked on multiple sequences setting up lighting mood and compositing template on master and keyshots.
I led one the sequence in the candy factory, the biggest sequence of the film over 80 shots. I worked on most of the keyshots. I provided feedback to artists based on notes from the production designer and supervisor, and supported them until final approval.</description>

      <description>A very special project. I joined the show at the end for the last push. The amount of work done in compositing was tremendous, a lot was done in Nuke where we could be creative.
I worked on multiple sequences on lighting and shared some shots for the compositing task.</description>

      <description>First project with Katana. After one week of training that taught us the basics of Katana, we jumped into production.
Making the white characters readable on white snow was challenging. Scene optimization was a must for a show with crowd of hairy characters.
I worked on multiple sequences from lighting to compositing, 3D stereo included.</description>
