      <description>Introduction Sonic Prime was the first show using Katana at Wildbrain. Most of the artists had no previous experience with this software. They had to be train and helped during production.
The lighting department had two teams, each one was composed of one lead, three seniors and eight artists. My role was to lead my team and achieve the creative lighting goals of the director for the episode.
Preparing I had to plan episode to achieve deliverables.</description>
