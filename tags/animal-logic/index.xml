      <description>Most of the job was character lighting. First we had a blocking phase with colorchecker and mirror/gray ball matching. Shot lighting was adding lights and special treatment for the eyes.
The sequences taking place in the burrow were fully done in CG. Some compositing was done by the lighting team before handing off the compositing team.</description>

      <description>My first animated feature, I believe this is one of the experience where I learnt the most in my career. I worked on multiple sequences from lighting to compositing, 3D stereo included.</description>
