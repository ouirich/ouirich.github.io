      <description>I started on the project by doing some lookdev work on different assets: vegetation and music instruments. I was in charge of lighting most of the shots in the jungle path sequence.
Mathematic was still a small studio, making a 5 minutes in full CG in less than 4 months was challenging. The set dressing has been made in a way to make the jungle dense. The biggest difficulty we had was making the light go through all that vegetation.</description>
