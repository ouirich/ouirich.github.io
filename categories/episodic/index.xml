      <description>I worked on 6 shorts and 10 episodes of the first season. Each episode was 11 minutes long and usually had between 4 or 5 keyshots. Most of the time I was in charge of 2 or 3 that had effects. My role was to setup keyshots in lighting and compositing beforehand. I would then work with my team on the rest of the episode.</description>

      <description>My first project on episodic. The process is quite different than feature. You rely on being the most efficient possible, and setting things up globally. One unique light rig to rule them all. I worked on episode 1 and 3. My sequences were for the most part heavy in effects (snow storm and sand storm).</description>
