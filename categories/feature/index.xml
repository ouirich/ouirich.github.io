      <description>Coming back to Animal Logic after five years as a senior lighting artist. The studio developped their own lighting software for their USD pipeline. But thanks to my previous expeience, it was fairly easy to pick it up. Mostly because the logic behind it was still the same.
We don&amp;rsquo;t always work on the most exciting shots on a production. As I started, another artist left. So I ended up picking up their shots to complete them.</description>

      <description>Worked on multiple sequences setting up lighting mood and compositing template on master and keyshots.
I led one the sequence in the candy factory, the biggest sequence of the film over 80 shots. I worked on most of the keyshots. I provided feedback to artists based on notes from the production designer and supervisor, and supported them until final approval.</description>

      <description>A very special project. I joined the show at the end for the last push. The amount of work done in compositing was tremendous, a lot was done in Nuke where we could be creative.
I worked on multiple sequences on lighting and shared some shots for the compositing task.</description>

      <description>First project with Katana. After one week of training that taught us the basics of Katana, we jumped into production.
Making the white characters readable on white snow was challenging. Scene optimization was a must for a show with crowd of hairy characters.
I worked on multiple sequences from lighting to compositing, 3D stereo included.</description>

      <description>Most of the job was character lighting. First we had a blocking phase with colorchecker and mirror/gray ball matching. Shot lighting was adding lights and special treatment for the eyes.
The sequences taking place in the burrow were fully done in CG. Some compositing was done by the lighting team before handing off to the compositing team.</description>

      <description>Moving from small studios in Paris to one of the biggest studio in London was challenging. I learned what was expected from me on a feature film in a big studio. I also got used to adapt to new pipeline and tools quickly to be efficient.
Lighting of the Enterprise, swarm ship, turbo lift and torpedo (Planet excluded)</description>
