      <description>My very first big project. I started on the project by doing some lookdev work on different assets: vegetation and music instruments. I was in charge of lighting most of the shots in the jungle path sequence.
Mathematic was still a small studio, making a 5 minutes in full CG in less than 4 months was challenging. The set dressing has been made in a way to make the jungle dense.</description>
